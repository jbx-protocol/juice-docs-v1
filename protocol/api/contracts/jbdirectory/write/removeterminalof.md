**Remove a terminal from a project's list of terminals.**

_Only a project owner or an operator can remove one of its terminals._

### Definition

```solidity
function removeTerminalOf(uint256 _projectId, IJBTerminal _terminal)
  external
  override
  requirePermission(projects.ownerOf(_projectId), _projectId, JBOperations.REMOVE_TERMINAL) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project having a terminal removed.
  * `_terminal` is the terminal to remove.
* Through the [`requirePermission`](../../or-abstract/jboperatable/modifiers/requirepermission.md) modifier, the function is only accessible by the project's owner, or from an operator that has been given the `JBOperations.REMOVE_TERMINAL`permission by the project owner for the provided `_projectId`.
* The function overrides a function definition from the `IJBDirectory` interface.
* The function returns nothing.

### Body

1.  Get a reference to the project's terminals.

    ```solidity
    // Get a reference to the terminals of the project.
    IJBTerminal[] memory _terminals = _terminalsOf[_projectId];
    ```

    Internal references:

    * [`_terminalsOf`](../properties/\_terminalsof.md)
2.  Delete all terminals from storage. All terminals except the one being removed will later be repupulated.

    ```solidity
    // Delete the stored terminals for the project.
    delete _terminalsOf[_projectId];
    ```

    Internal references:

    * [`_terminalsOf`](../properties/\_terminalsof.md)
3.  Loop through the terminals, adding all terminals that aren't the one being removed back into storage.

    ```solidity
    // Repopulate the stored terminals for the project, omitting the one being deleted.
    for (uint256 _i; _i < _terminals.length; _i++)
      // Don't include the terminal being deleted.
      if (_terminals[_i] != _terminal) _terminalsOf[_projectId].push(_terminals[_i]);
    ```

    Internal references:

    * [`_terminalsOf`](../properties/\_terminalsof.md)
4.  If the terminal being removed is set to be the primary terminal for its vault's token, delete it from being the primary terminal.

    ```solidity
    // If the terminal that is being removed is the primary terminal for the token, delete it from being primary terminal.
    if (_primaryTerminalOf[_projectId][_terminal.vault().token()] == _terminal)
      delete _primaryTerminalOf[_projectId][_terminal.vault().token()];
    ```

    Internal references:

    * [`_primaryTerminalOf`](../properties/\_primaryterminalof.md)
5.  Emit a `RemoveTerminal` event with the relevant parameters.

    ```solidity
    emit RemoveTerminal(_projectId, _terminal, msg.sender);
    ```

    _Event references:_

    * [`RemoveTerminal`](../events/removeterminal.md)
