```solidity
function pay(
  uint256 _projectId,

  uint256 _minReturnedTokens,
  bool _preferClaimedTokens,
  string calldata _memo,
  bytes calldata _delegateMetadata
) external payable override { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project being paid.
  * `_beneficiary` is the address to mint tokens for and pass along to the funding cycle's data source and delegate.
  * `_minReturnedTokens` is the minimum number of tokens expected in return.
  * `_preferClaimedTokens` is a flag indicating whether the request prefers to issue tokens unstaked rather than staked.
  * `_memo` is a memo to pass along to the emitted event, and passed along the the funding cycle's data source and delegate.
  * `_delegateMetadata` are bytes to send along to the delegate, if one is provided.
* The function can be accessed externally by anyone.
* The function accepts ETH.
* The resulting function overrides a function definition from the `IJBPaymentTerminal` interface.
* The function doesn't return anything.

#### Body
