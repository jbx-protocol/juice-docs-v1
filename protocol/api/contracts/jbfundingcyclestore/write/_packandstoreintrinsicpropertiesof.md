{% tab title="Step by step" %}
**Efficiently stores a funding cycle's provided intrinsic properties.**

### Definition

```solidity
function _packAndStoreIntrinsicPropertiesOf(
  uint256 _configuration,
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _number,
  uint256 _weight,
  uint256 _basedOn,
  uint256 _start
) private { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_configuration` is the configuration of the funding cycle to pack and store.
  * `_projectId` is the ID of the project to which the funding cycle belongs.
  * `_number` is the number of the funding cycle.
  * `_weight` is the weight of the funding cycle.
  * `_basedOn` is the configuration of the based funding cycle.
  * `_start` is the start time of this funding cycle.
* The function is private to this contract.
* The function doesn't return anything.

### Body

1.  The `_weight` property should take up the first 80 bits of the packed `uint256`.

    ```solidity
    // weight in bytes 0-79 bits.
    uint256 packed = _weight;
    ```
2.  The `_basedOn` should take up the next 56 bits.

    ```solidity
    // basedOn in bits 88-143.
    packed |= _basedOn << 88;
    ```
3.  The `_start` should take up the next 56 bits.

    ```solidity
    // start in bits 144-199.
    packed |= _start << 144;
    ```
4.  The `_number` should take up the last 56 bits.

    ```solidity
    // number in bits 200-255.
    packed |= _number << 200;
    ```
5.  Store the packed intrinsic properties for the funding cycle.

    ```solidity
    // Set in storage.
    _packedIntrinsicPropertiesOf[_projectId][_configuration] = packed;
    ```
