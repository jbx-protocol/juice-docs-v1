**The accumulated weight change since the specified funding cycle.**

#### Definition

```solidity
function _deriveWeightFrom(JBFundingCycle memory _baseFundingCycle, uint256 _start)
  private
  pure
  returns (uint256 weight) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_baseFundingCycle` is The [`JBFundingCycle`](../../../data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md) to make the calculation for.
  * `_start` is a time that the cycle having a weight derived for starts.
* The view function is private to this contract.
* The function does not alter state on the blockchain.
* The function returns a weight with 18 decimal places.

#### Body

1.  If the base funding cycle has no duration, the derived weight should be calculated from it no matter how much time has passed since it was active. The `discountRate` property in a [`JBFundingCycle`](../../../data-structures/jbfundingcycle.md)is out of 10000. Discount rates represent a number between 0-100%, with 0.01% fidelity, so the calculation must be made out of 10000.

    ```solidity
    // A subsequent cycle to one with a duration of 0 should have the next possible weight.
    if (_baseFundingCycle.duration == 0)
      return
        PRBMath.mulDiv(
          _baseFundingCycle.weight,
          JBConstants.MAX_DISCOUNT_RATE - _baseFundingCycle.discountRate,
          JBConstants.MAX_DISCOUNT_RATE
        );
    ```

    _Libraries used:_

    * [`PRBMath`](https://github.com/hifi-finance/prb-math/blob/main/contracts/PRBMath.sol)
      * `.mulDiv`
    * [`JBConstants`](../../../libraries/jbconstants.md)
      * `.MAX_DISCOUNT_RATE`
2.  The calculations that follow will progressively apply discount rates to the `_baseFundingCycle`'s weight to arrive at the correct weight to return.

    ```solidity
    // The weight should be based off the base funding cycle's weight.
    weight = _baseFundingCycle.weight;
    ```
3.  If the base doesn't have a discount rate, the original weight won't change and should be returned.

    ```solidity
    // If the discount is 0, the weight doesn't change.
    if (_baseFundingCycle.discountRate == 0) return weight;
    ```
4.  Get a reference to how long after the `_baseFundingCycle`'s start the specified `_start` time is. The goal will be to see how many cycles have passed within this time distance.

    ```solidity
    // The difference between the start of the base funding cycle and the proposed start.
    uint256 _startDistance = _start - _baseFundingCycle.start;
    ```
5.  Apply the `_baseFundingCycle`'s discount rate. Apply the rate as many times as there have been cycles within the `_startDistance`. No need to keep iterating if the weight has reached 0.

    ```solidity
    // Apply the base funding cycle's discount rate, if necessary.
    uint256 _discountMultiple = _startDistance / _baseFundingCycle.duration;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _discountMultiple; i++) {
      // The number of times to apply the discount rate.
      // Base the new weight on the specified funding cycle's weight.
      weight = PRBMath.mulDiv(
        weight,
        JBConstants.MAX_DISCOUNT_RATE - _baseFundingCycle.discountRate,
        JBConstants.MAX_DISCOUNT_RATE
      );
      // The calculation doesn't need to continue if the weight is 0.
      if (weight == 0) break;
    }
    ```
