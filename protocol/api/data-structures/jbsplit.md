* `preferClaimed` is a flag that only has effect if a `projectId` is also specified, and that project has [`issued`](../contracts/jbtokenstore/write/issuefor.md)its tokens. If so, this flag indicates if the tokens that result from making a payment to the project should be delivered as claimed ERC-20's to the `beneficiary`.
* `percent` is the percent of the whole group that this split occupies. This number is out of 10000.
* If an `allocator` is not set but a `projectId `is set, funds will be sent to the Juicebox treasury belonging to the project who's ID is specified.
*   The role the `beneficary` depends on whether or not `projectId` is specified, or whether or not `allocator` is specified. If `allocator` is set, the `beneficiary` will be forwarded to the `allocator` for it to use. `pallocator` is not set but

    If `projectId` is set, the `beneficiary` is the address to which the project's tokens will be sent that result from a payment to it. If neither `allocator` nor `projectId`are set, the `beneficiary` is where the funds from the split will be sent.
* If an `allocator` is specified, funds will be sent to the `allocator` contract along with the `projectId`, `beneficiary`, `preferUnstaked` properties.
* `lockedUntil` specifies if the split should be unchangeable until the specifies time comes, with the exception of extending the `lockedUntil` period.
