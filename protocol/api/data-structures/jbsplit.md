# Definition

```solidity
struct JBSplit {
  // A flag that only has effect if a projectId is also specified, and the project has a token contract attached.
  // If so, this flag indicates if the tokens that result from making a payment to the project should be delivered claimed into the beneficiary's wallet, or unclaimed to save gas.
  bool preferClaimed;
  // The percent of the whole group that this split occupies. This number is out of `JBConstants.SPLITS_TOTAL_PERCENT`.
  uint256 percent;
  // If an allocator is not set but a projectId is set, funds will be sent to the protocol treasury belonging to the project who's ID is specified.
  // Resulting tokens will be routed to the beneficiary with the claimed token preference respected.
  uint256 projectId;
  // The role the of the beneficary depends on whether or not projectId is specified, and whether or not an allocator is specified.
  // If allocator is set, the beneficiary will be forwarded to the allocator for it to use.
  // If allocator is not set but projectId is set, the beneficiary is the address to which the project's tokens will be sent that result from a payment to it.
  // If neither allocator or projectId are set, the beneficiary is where the funds from the split will be sent.
  address payable beneficiary;
  // Specifies if the split should be unchangeable until the specified time, with the exception of extending the locked period.
  uint256 lockedUntil;
  // If an allocator is specified, funds will be sent to the allocator contract along with all properties of this split.
