# JBFundingCycle

```solidity
struct JBFundingCycle {
  // The funding cycle number for each project.
  // Each funding cycle has a number that is an increment of the cycle that directly preceded it.
  // Each project's first funding cycle has a number of 1.
  uint256 number;
  // The timestamp when the parameters for this funding cycle were configured.
  // This value will stay the same for subsequent funding cycles that roll over from an originally configured cycle.
  uint256 configuration;
  // The `configuration` of the funding cycle that was active when this cycle was created.
  uint256 basedOn;
  // The timestamp marking the moment from which the funding cycle is considered active.
  // It is a unix timestamp measured in seconds.
  uint256 start;
  // The number of seconds the funding cycle lasts for, after which a new funding cycle will start.
  // A duration of 0 means that the funding cycle will stay active until the project owner explicitly issues a reconfiguration, at which point a new funding cycle will immediately start with the updated properties.
  // If the duration is greater than 0, a project owner cannot make changes to a funding cycle's parameters while it is active â€“ any proposed changes will apply to the subsequent cycle.
  // If no changes are proposed, a funding cycle rolls over to another one with the same properties but new `start` timestamp and a discounted `weight`.
  uint256 duration;
  // A fixed point number with 18 decimals that contracts can use to base arbitrary calculations on.
  // For example, payment terminals can use this to determine how many tokens should be minted when a payment is received.
  uint256 weight;
  // A percent by how much the `weight` of the subsequent funding cycle should be reduced, if the project owner hasn't configured the subsequent funding cycle with an explicit `weight`.
  // If it's 0, each funding cycle will have equal weight.
  // If the number is 90%, the next funding cycle will have a 10% smaller weight.
  // This weight is out of `JBConstants.MAX_DISCOUNT_RATE`.
  uint256 discountRate;
  // An address of a contract that says whether a proposed reconfiguration should be accepted or rejected.
  // It can be used to create rules around how a project owner can change funding cycle parameters over time.
  IJBFundingCycleBallot ballot;
  // Extra data that can be associated with a funding cycle.
