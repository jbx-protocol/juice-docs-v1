# Definition

```solidity
struct JBOperatorData {
  // The address of the operator.
  address operator;
  // The domain within which the operator is being given permissions.
  uint256 domain;
  // The indexes of the permissions the operator is being given.
  uint256[] permissionIndexes;
}
```

* `operators` are the operator to whom permissions will be given.
* `domains` is lists the domain that each operator is being given permissions to operate. A value of 0 serves as a wildcard domain. Applications can specify their own domain system.
* `permissionIndexes` lists the [`JBOperation`](../libraries/jboperations.md) indexes to set for each operator. Indexes must be between 0-255. Applications can specify the significance of each index.
