**Records newly distributed funds for a project.**

_Only the associated payment terminal can record a used allowance._

# Definition

```solidity
function recordWithdrawalFor(
  uint256 _projectId,
  uint256 _amount,
  uint256 _currency,
  uint256 _minReturnedWei
)
  external
  onlyAssociatedPaymentTerminal
  returns (JBFundingCycle memory fundingCycle, uint256 withdrawnAmount) { ... }
```

* Arguments:
  * `_projectId` The ID of the project that is having funds withdrawn.
  * `_amount` The amount being withdrawn. Send as wei (18 decimals).
  * `_currency` The expected currency of the `_amount` being tapped. This must match the project's current funding cycle's currency.
  * `_minReturnedWei` The minimum number of wei that should be withdrawn.
* Through the [`onlyAssociatedPaymentTerminal`](../modifiers/onlyassociatedpaymentterminal.md) modifier, the function is only accessible by the terminal that claimed this store.
* The function returns:
  * `fundingCycle` is the funding cycle during which the withdrawal was made.
  * `withdrawnAmount` is the amount withdrawn.

# Body

1.  Get a reference to the project's current funding cycle.

    ```solidity
    // Get a reference to the project's current funding cycle.
    fundingCycle = fundingCycleStore.currentOf(_projectId);
    ```

    _External references:_

    * [`currentOf`](../../../jbfundingcyclestore/read/currentof.md)
2.  Make sure the current funding cycle doesn't have distributions paused.

    ```solidity
    // The funding cycle must not be configured to have distributions paused.
    require(!fundingCycle.distributionsPaused(), '0x3e: PAUSED');
    ```

    _Libraries used:_

    * [`JBFundingCycleMetadataResolver`](../../../../libraries/jbfundingcyclemetadataresolver.md)\
      `.distributionsPaused(...)`
3.  Make the sure the provided currency matches the expected currency for the distribution limit.

    ```solidity
    // Make sure the currencies match.
    require(
      _currency ==
        directory.controllerOf(_projectId).currencyOf(
          _projectId,
          fundingCycle.configuration,
          terminal
        ),
      '0x3f: UNEXPECTED_CURRENCY'
    );
    ```

    _External references:_

    * [`currencyOf`](../../../or-controllers/jbcontroller/read/currencyof.md)
4.  Calculate the new total amount that has been distributed during this funding cycle by adding the amount being distributed to the used distribution limit.

    ```solidity
    // The new total amount that has been distributed during this funding cycle.
    uint256 _newUsedDistributionLimitOf = usedDistributionLimitOf[_projectId][fundingCycle.number] +
      _amount;
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`usedDistributionLimitOf`](../../../jbfundingcyclestore/read/useddistributionlimitof.md)
5.  Make sure the new total amount distributed will be at most the distribution limit.

    ```solidity
    // Amount must be within what is still distributable.
    require(
      _newUsedDistributionLimitOf <=
        directory.controllerOf(_projectId).distributionLimitOf(
          _projectId,
          fundingCycle.configuration,
          terminal
        ),
      '0x1b: INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS'
    );
    ```

    _External references:_

    * [`distributionLimitOf`](../../../or-controllers/jbcontroller/read/distributionlimitof.md)
6.  Find the amount to distribute by converting the amount to ETH. If the currency is 0, it is assumed that the currency is the same as the token being withdrawn so no conversion is necessary.

    ```solidity
    // Convert the amount to wei.
    // A currency of 0 should be interpreted as whatever the currency being distributed is.
    distributedAmount = _currency == 0
      ? _amount
      : PRBMathUD60x18.div(_amount, prices.priceFor(_currency, JBCurrencies.ETH));
    ```

    _Libraries used:_

    * [`PRBMathUD60x18`](https://github.com/hifi-finance/prb-math/blob/main/contracts/PRBMathUD60x18.sol)
      * `.div`
7.  Make sure the project has access to the amount being distributed.

    ```solidity
    // The amount being distributed must be available.
    require(distributedAmount <= balanceOf[_projectId], '0x40: INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS');
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`balanceOf`](../../../jbfundingcyclestore/read/balanceof.md)
8.  Make sure there is at least as much wei being withdrawn as expected.

    ```solidity
    // The amount being distributed must be at least as much as was expected.
    require(_minReturnedWei <= distributedAmount, '0x41: INADEQUATE');
    ```
9.  Store the new used distributed amount.

    ```solidity
    // Store the new amount.
    usedDistributionLimitOf[_projectId][fundingCycle.number] = _newUsedDistributionLimitOf;
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`usedDistributionLimitOf`](../../../jbfundingcyclestore/read/useddistributionlimitof.md)
10. Store the decremented balance.

    ```solidity
    // Removed the withdrawn funds from the project's balance.
    balanceOf[_projectId] = balanceOf[_projectId] - withdrawnAmount;
    ```

    _Internal references:_

    * [`balanceOf`](../../../jbfundingcyclestore/read/balanceof.md)
