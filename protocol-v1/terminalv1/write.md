### acceptGovernance

Allows contract to accept its appointment as the new governance.\
Only the pending governance can accept.

```
function acceptGovernance() external;
```

### addToBalance

Receives and allocates funds belonging to the specified project.

**Params:**

* **_projectId**: The ID of the project to which the funds received belong.

```
function addToBalance(uint256 _projectId) external payable;
```

### allowMigration

Adds to the contract addresses that projects can migrate their Tickets to.

Only governance can add a contract to the migration allow list.

**Params:**

* **_contract**: The contract to allow.

```
function allowMigration(ITerminal _contract) external;

### configure

Configures the properties of the current funding cycle if the project hasn't distributed tickets yet, or sets the properties of the proposed funding cycle that will take effect once the current one expires if it is approved by the current funding cycle's ballot.

Only a project's owner or a designated operator can configure its funding cycles.

**Params:**

* **_projectId**: The ID of the project being reconfigured.
* **_properties**: The funding cycle configuration.
  * **_properties.target**: The amount that the project wants to receive in this funding stage. Sent as a wad.
  * **_properties.currency**: The currency of the \`target\`. Send 0 for ETH or 1 for USD.
  * **_properties.duration**: The duration of the funding stage for which the \`target\` amount is needed. Measured in days. Send 0 for a boundless cycle reconfigurable at any time.
  * **_properties.cycleLimit**: The number of cycles that this configuration should last for before going back to the last permanent. This has no effect for a project's first funding cycle.
  * **_properties.discountRate**: A number from 0-200 indicating how valuable a contribution to this funding stage is compared to the project's previous funding stage.
    * If it's 200, each funding stage will have equal weight.
    * If the number is 180, a contribution to the next funding stage will only give you 90% of tickets given to a contribution of the same amount during the current funding stage.
    * If the number is 0, an non-all transactions except the constructor are write functions recurring funding stage will get made.
  * **_properties.ballot**: The new ballot that will be used to approve subsequent reconfigurations.
* **_metadata**: A struct specifying the TerminalV1 specific params _bondingCurveRate, and _reservedRate.
*
  * **_metadata.reservedRate**: A number from 0-200 indicating the percentage of each contribution's tickets that will be reserved for the project owner.
  * **_metadata.bondingCurveRate**: The rate from 0-200 at which a project's Tickets can be redeemed for surplus. The bonding curve formula can be found [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sp9ru6zbpk), where x is _count, o is _currentOverflow, s is _totalSupply, and r is _bondingCurveRate.
  * **_metadata.reconfigurationBondingCurveRate**: The bonding curve rate to apply when there is an active ballot.

**Returns:** The ID of the funding cycle that was successfully configured.
