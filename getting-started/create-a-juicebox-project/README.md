# Creating a Juicebox Project

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Juicebox protocol is not formally audited. All projects built on it may be vulnerable to bugs or exploits. Be smart and be curious, ask questions if you've got any.
{% endhint %}

To create a Juicebox Project, press 'connect' in the top right corner of the [homepage](http://juicebox.money) to connect your wallet.

Next, click on 'Design your Project' or scroll down. The left side of the project design wizard shows you all the necessary configuration steps, and the right side previews what your project will look like once created.

{% hint style="info" %}
Consider creating a test project on the Rinkeby testnet version of Juicebox at [rinkeby.juicebox.money](http://rinkeby.juicebox.money) before creating project on Ethereum mainnet. To use the Rinkeby version of Juicebox, you'll have to change your wallet to the Rinkeby network.
